# Artemis Watch Firmware

## Quick Start (with Makefile)

This fork includes a `Makefile` for simplified setup, building and flashing.

### 1. One-time setup
```shell
make prepare
```
This clones ESP-IDF v5.1, installs tools and Python dependencies.

### 2. Build
```shell
make build
```

### 3. Flash
```shell
make flash PORT=/dev/ttyACM0
```
Replace `/dev/ttyACM0` with your device port (`COM6` on Windows, `/dev/cu.usbmodem*` on macOS).

### 4. Monitor serial output
```shell
make monitor PORT=/dev/ttyACM0
```

### 5. Merge into a single binary (for distribution)
```shell
make merge
```
Outputs `Artemis.bin` in the project root.

## Manual Build (ESP-IDF)

To build without the Makefile you'll need ESP-IDF v5.1,
commit [3a45d4e](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/3a45d4e949a174e8829a2e4c86c421b030ceac5a).
See the [getting started guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/).

### ESP-IDF patching

Contained in the repository is [ESP-IDF.patch](ESP-IDF.patch).
The patch addresses [issues](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/issues/11690) in IDF v5.1
related to FPU registers during context switching.

For proper code functioning, apply this patch onto your ESP-IDF installation path using:

```shell
cd /esp-idf-path/
git apply ESP-IDF.patch
```

Clone all submodules from the project root

```shell
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

### JPEGDEC patching

Contained in the repository is [JPEGDEC.patch](JPEGDEC.patch).
Apply it onto the cloned JPEGDEC submodule:

```shell
cd components/JPEGDEC
git apply ../../JPEGDEC.patch
```

### LovyanGFX patching

Contained in the repository is [LovyanGFX.patch](LovyanGFX.patch).
Apply it onto the cloned LovyanGFX submodule:

```shell
cd components/LovyanGFX
git apply ../../LovyanGFX.patch
```

After patching everything, in the root directory of the project:

**To build the firmware** run ```idf.py build```

**To upload the firmware to the device** run ```idf.py -p <PORT> flash```. Replace `<PORT>` with
the port Artemis is attached to, for ex. ```COM6``` or ```/dev/ttyACM0```.

### Merging a single binary file

After building (or flashing) the firmware, you can merge the resulting files into a single
binary file. This is useful for sharing a build or flashing it directly onto the board.

The necessary tool for this is [esptool](https://github.com/espressif/esptool), which comes
preinstalled with ESP-IDF

From the project root go into your build folder (usually just /build):

```shell
cd build
esptool --chip esp32s3 merge_bin --fill-flash-size 4MB -o ../Artemis.bin --flash_mode dio 
--flash_freq 80m --flash_size 4MB 0x0 bootloader/bootloader.bin 0x10000 Artemis-Firmware.bin 0x8000 partition_table/partition-table.bin 0x2f6000 storage.bin
```

## Restoring the stock firmware

To restore the stock firmware, you can download the prebuilt binary on
the [releases page](https://github.com/CircuitMess/GC_Artemis-Firmware/releases) of this repository
and flash it manually using esptool:

```shell
esptool -c esp32s3 -b 921600 -p <PORT> write_flash 0 Artemis-Firmware.bin
```

Alternatively, you can also do so using [CircuitBlocks](https://code.circuitmess.com/) by
logging in, clicking the "Restore Firmware" button in the top-right corner, and following the
on-screen instructions.

## Zareen Theme

This fork adds a custom watch face called **Zareen** — a space/night-sky theme.
See [`ZAREEN_THEME.md`](ZAREEN_THEME.md) for full documentation.

To build the Artemis base firmware, you'll need the ESP-IDF. You can find the getting started
guide [here](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/). The
production firmware is built using IDF version 5.1,
commit [3a45d4e](https://github.com/espressif/esp-idf/tree/3a45d4e949a174e8829a2e4c86c421b030ceac5a).
